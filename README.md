Time Series Forecasting Workflow - Workshop
 Session 2: Time Series Forecasting Workflow using Python

 1. Introduction to Time Series Forecasting
   - Overview of time series forecasting and its business use cases (e.g., sales prediction, demand forecasting).
   - Introduction to key Python libraries: Pandas for data manipulation, Statsmodels for time series analysis, and Scikit-learn for regression models.

 2. Workflow 1: Time Series Data Preparation using Pandas
   - Objective: Prepare time series data for forecasting.
     - Load and inspect time series data using Pandas.
     - Handle missing values, date parsing, and resampling the time series.
     - Decompose the time series into trend, seasonality, and residual components using Statsmodels.
     - Hands-on Example: Prepare a dataset of monthly sales data for analysis and decomposition.

 3. Workflow 2: Building a Time Series Forecasting Model
   - Objective: Build and evaluate a time series forecasting model using Statsmodels or Scikit-learn.
   - Steps:
     - Use ARIMA or Exponential Smoothing models from Statsmodels to build a forecasting model.
     - Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
     - Train the model and make future predictions.
     - Evaluate the forecasting model using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE) or Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE).
     - Hands-on Example: Forecast future sales based on historical data using ARIMA.
